Approach Used - 
First I am finding all the possible combinations that can be made with given n long array of colored balls with each occurence length = k.
Then I am finding the occurences which contains same elements and storing all of their indices except one.
Then I am deleting the elements with those collected indices.

Time Complexity - O(n^3 + 3(n + 1))
